# Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for phai — the record of *why* each structural choice was made, so future contributors don't have to re-derive it from `git log`.

## Format

Each ADR is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter. Use the template below (also available at [`0000-template.md`](0000-template.md)).

```markdown
---
type: ADR
id: "NNNN"
title: "Short decision title"
status: proposed        # proposed | active | superseded | retired
date: YYYY-MM-DD
superseded_by: "NNNN"  # only if status: superseded
---

## Context
What situation led to this decision? What forces and constraints are at play?

## Decision
**What was decided.** State it clearly in one or two sentences — bold so it stands out.

## Options considered
- **Option A** (chosen): brief description — pros / cons
- **Option B**: brief description — pros / cons
- **Option C**: brief description — pros / cons

## Consequences
What becomes easier or harder as a result?
What are the positive and negative ramifications?
What would trigger re-evaluation of this decision?
```

### Status lifecycle

```
proposed → active → superseded
                 ↘ retired      (decision no longer relevant, not replaced)
```

## Rules

- One decision per file.
- File name: `NNNN-short-title.md`, monotonic numbering.
- Once `active`, **never edit** — supersede with a new ADR instead.
- When superseded: update `status: superseded`, add `superseded_by: "NNNN"`, and link from the new ADR's Context.
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) reflects the current state (active decisions only). When an ADR supersedes another, update ARCHITECTURE.md in the same commit.
